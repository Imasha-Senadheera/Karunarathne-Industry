# Karunarathne-Industry

#### Background </br>

As part of the expansion plans of Karunarathne Industries, a new branch will be opened in the Colombo area. </br>
Unfortunately, the power tools they sell are located in separate buildings. In each building, there are three main flows. The same identical products are sold in two buildings. Each flow is staffed by a single cashier. Therefore, there are six cashiers in these two buildings. With this approach, customers have easy access to assistance and seamless transactions when exploring the extensive range of power tools available

</br>
</br>

#### Challenge </br>

The shop owner is requesting the system to manage his shop. He gave the below requirements for you to develop that system.
1. He is planning to use one centralized database for those two buildings.
2. Each cashier can access the database individually.
3. He needs to track all the sales with cashier details.
4. The owner needs to manage his stock through that system. ( GRN / Invoice / Purchase Order )
5. At the end of the day, he needs each flow profit and total profit.
6. The owner requested some graphs to visualize when in the reporting part.
7. The manager is the person who is responsible for managing the stock of the shop.
8. The owner is planning to give some discounts to his loyal customers.
9. The owner needs to view his product quantity updates in real time without doing anything in the interface.
10. Users can't log in to the system before 8.00 a.m. and they should automatically log out at 6.00 p.m.
